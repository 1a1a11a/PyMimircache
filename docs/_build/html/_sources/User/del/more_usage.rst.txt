mimircache and its components
-----------------------------
Current version of mimircache is composed of three main components, the first one is cache, which simulates corresponding cache replacement algorithm,
the second one is cacheReader, which provides all the necessary functions for reading and examing trace data file, and most important of all, for extracting data for profiling.
The third type of objects are the profilers. Currently, we have three kinds of profilers, the first one is LRU profiler, specially tailored for LRU;
the second one is a general profiler for profiling all non-LRU cache replacement algorithms;
the third profiler is heatmap plot engine, currently supports a variety of heatmap.
LRUProfiler is in C, so it is pretty fast, the rest two profilers have corresponding C implementation (cGeneralProfiler and cHeatmap) used for caches available in C.

Each components have some more functions than described in tutorial, read the source code or raise a new issue in github
if you want to know more or have questions.


Write your own cacheReader
--------------------------
.. _create_new_cache_reader:

Writing your own cacheReader is not difficult, just inherit abstractCacheReader.py.
Here is an example::

    from mimircache.cacheReader.abstractReader import cacheReaderAbstract

    class plainCacheReader(cacheReaderAbstract):
        def __init__(self, file_loc):
            super(plainCacheReader, self).__init__(file_loc)
            self.trace_file = open(file_loc, 'r')

        def read_one_element(self):
            super().read_one_element()
            line = self.trace_file.readline()
            if line:
                return line.strip()
            else:
                return None

        def __next__(self):
            super().__next__()
            element = self.trace_file.readline().strip()
            if element:
                return element
            else:
                raise StopIteration

        def __repr__(self):
            return "basic cache reader, cache trace separated by line, %s" % super().__repr__()


After writing your own cache reader, you can use it on generalProfiler and heatmap, for example:

    >>> reader = vscsiCacheReader(PATH/TO/DATA)
    >>> p = generalProfiler(reader, "FIFO", cache_size, bin_size=bin_size, num_of_process=8)

the first parameter is the cacheReader object of your own, the second is the cache replacement algorithm,
the third parameter is cache size, the fourth parameter is bin_size, and it can be omitted, in which case, the default bin_size if cache_size/100.


    >>> hm = heatmap()
    >>> hm.heatmap(reader, 'r', TIME_INTERVAL, "hit_rate_start_time_end_time", cache_size=CACHE_SIZE)

The usage of new cache replacement algorithm is the same as the one in last section, just replace the algorithm string
with your algorithm class.

Profiling in python is only applicable on small data set, so you can use it to verify your idea, when running on large
dataset, we suggested implemented the algorithms in C, check the source code to find out how to implement in C.
